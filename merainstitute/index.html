	<section class="mi-about">
		<h2 class="font--serif">About</h2>
		<p>Launched in May 2015, merainstitute.com is an aggregation of coaching institutes all across India. The word "merainstitute" is made up of two words - "mera", meaning "my" in Hindi, and "institute". So the website means “my institute”, where a student can come and choose the best institute to prepare for his intended exam.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="mi-logo">
		<h2 class="font--serif">Logo</h2>
		<p>My intention for the logo was to be minimal and flat. After experimenting with numerous typographic designs, I decided to focus on the "m" and "i". Consequently, the web has seen only the following three logos with the third being final. It perfectly captures both the alphabets in a single shape.</p>

	<section class="mi-banner">
		<h2 class="font--serif">Banner</h2>
		<p>Every coaching institute that has an account on the website is provided with a virtual website of its own called a "banner". It is a summary of the institute information showcasing faculty, results, courses offered, centers, etc. It also contains reviews from various students. The intention of the banner is to allow less popular coaching institutes have a descent presence on the web. The banner also serves as a source of information to the visiting students.<br /><br />Below is a screenshot of a banner of a dummy institute on my developmemt environment.</p>

	<section class="mi-inst-pages">
		<h2 class="font--serif">Pages</h2>
		<p>Other than the banner, every institute also gets dedicated pages for their team (faculty), achievers (results), courses and more.<br /><br />Below is a screenshot of a dummy institute's achievers page.</p>

	<section class="mi-inst-portfolio">
		<h2 class="font--serif">Portfolio</h2>
		<p>All the information made available in the pages described above is fed into the system via a "portfolio". This portfolio can only be accessed by a institute after logging into the website. The portfolio is basically a lengthy form equipped with partial saves and separated into logical sections. Each section is accessible throught tabs that are present on the top as well as the bottom.<br /><br />Below is a screenshot of a dummy institute's portfolio.</p>

	<section class="mi-add-batch">
		<h2 class="font--serif">Batches</h2>
		<p>Every coaching institute usually has a course that is run in multiple batches to accommodate a large number of students. These batches contain information such as the start date, end date, duration, slots and fees.<br /><br />Below is a screenshot of the form used by an institute to fill up this information.</p>

	<section class="mi-conclusion">
		<h2 class="font--serif">Conclusion</h2>
		<p>merainstitute is one of my greatest accomplishments. I designed the website keeping in mind that people well acquainted with computers (students) as well as people with less exposure to computers (some institute personnel) are able to use the website easily and aid their business through merainstitute.</p>
