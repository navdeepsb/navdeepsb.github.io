			Back in those days when the summers were cosy and the trees were tall, I had all the opportunities to take a glance and look at all the visual treats this world had to offer me. After a busy half-day of joyful laughs and the dreamy school chores, I managed to pick up a seat in my school bus. Usually, I would throw my bag on this seat to reserve it and race down to where my friends were standing to tell and hear some of the most spectacular real stories children could ever imagine, but today was different. Today I didn't want to take any chances. I didn't want to flash silly smiles to my ruthless bus-mates who didn't heed my bag and claimed my seat. So I stayed in the bus. I fixed my eyes on the giant bronze school emblem that looked so magnificent on the front top of the red school building, shining like there was room for one more sun in this universe. I had to look at it. I had to look at it so I could prepare my eyes for the grand finale.
			<br />
			<br />
			Slowly and eventually, the volume of the roaring in the bus increased and then attained a level that made it impossible for me to catch the sound of the engine starting, otherwise for which my ears were super-sensitive as it signalled the end of my friendly chat and the time to board. The ground started moving and my journey began. The wind was kind enough to evaporate the sweat off of my head. I donned a huge smile on my face as I just couldn't control the enthusiasm of a ten year old. Today, I was going to be able to focus my entire attention on the single most important thing that had made my heart jump in joy the day before yesterday.
			<br />
			<br />
			After spending some time in the drowsy ride of my magic bus, the moment came for which I had been laying the red carpet for. The bus stopped and I prayed the person expected to get off the bus moved slowly. This way, I would get ample amount of time for my eyes to savour. My calculations regarding on which side of the bus I will be able to view my visual treat were correct and they had landed me on the starboard side of the bus. Without much ado, I turned my head to perfectly lock my eyes on this variegated jester that was standing outside a restaurant. He was wearing these red and blue clothes, an abstruse set of shoes and a peculiarly shaped hat that sat prominently on his head. My best guess was that he was hired by the restaurant owner to allure customers to this place. The trick was ingenious as I was not only allured but also genuinely mesmerized. I had seen many jesters before, but this one was unique. This one was full of tremendous verve and the sight of a colourful figure in a concrete landscape was just fantastic. He was jumping and juggling balls and as he did so, yellow, orange and green candies spilled from his pockets. Some desirous kids surrounding him were grabbing those candies even before they could touch the ground. I envied those kids as I couldn't relish any of that jester-bestowed candy myself. That big grin on the jester’s face was utterly genuine as he enjoyed every bit of his act. Just yesterday, I had visited this place in the evening with my parents in hopes of seeing the jester up close but I couldn’t find him then. I was sad and disappointed but today’s events had healed any wounds. Even today, a loud voice in my head was asking me to rush down the bus, meet the jester, have some candy and be back in a jiffy but I couldn’t oblige as my bus revived to move. I bid bye to the jester king and got myself a memory that I still cherish.
			<br />
			<br />
			This incident made me ponder upon the existence of tiny joys that exist in our otherwise mundane lives - the joys that go unnoticed until we recognize them. The giant green trees that you see behind the traffic signal while waiting on a red light or the cloud art seen in the sky every now and then or the dark cool shade beneath an array of overgrown bushes all bring much needed peace and calm to the restless mind. I have many such memoirs but the jester memoir sits on the top. These memoirs enrich my heart with joy and whenever I recall them I am filled with a profound nostalgia that never fails to leave me smiling.
