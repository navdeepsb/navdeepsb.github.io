We were assigned to create a poster inviting (more) participation in research studies related to Cognitive Control and Obesity. I decided to convey a story through the recruitment poster. I wanted to build up on parent-child relationship to invoke an emotional response from my users. I thought of depicting certain playful activities that could be fairly easily performed by obese parents, such as a kid bouncing off their parent's soft belly, etc. Next, I adopted the <a href='https://design.tutsplus.com/articles/what-exactly-is-this-japanese-trend-known-as-kawaii-all-about--vector-15984' target='blank' rel='nofollow'>Kawaii illustration style</a> for my characters since the Kawaii characters are frequently drawn as chubby and cute.<br /><br /><br />Below is the final and version 2 of the poster:",
