			It is the 70's era, the peak of Classic Rock and Led Zeppelin, the Gods, are performing live in an auditorium. Although the size of the auditorium didn’t justify the greatness of this rock group, they are playing their hearts out. Astonishingly and rather so audaciously, the audience is very meagre. I am standing closest to them and fully engaged in the mind-boggling super-experience. They are playing Good Times Bad Times and the guitar solo after that deliberate brief pause in the music lifts me away from this world and into the depths of psych and bliss. This was the last number they were going to perform before leaving for another gig. Parallel to this hall is another hall that connects the backstage to the exit. I migrate to this parallel hall in hopes of coming face-to-face with the greatest band ever and take autographs of the big four.
			<br />
			<br />
			I am standing close to the exit door and see Led Zeppelin coming towards me flocked with reporters, journalists and other crazy fans. I am holding a click pen and a scrap of newspaper for taking their autographs. A few photographers are also there bursting their camera flashes in the dim hall. Leading Led Zeppelin is mighty Jimmy Page. I shake hands with him and tell him that I'm a huge fan of his and that I want his autograph. He refuses and gushes to the exit. I am under extreme shock and before I could recover, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones have already walked past me. I bring myself to senses as soon as possible and ask John Bonham, the immortal king of the drummers, for his autograph. He gestures for a pen which I give him along with the paper. He signs "Bonzo" and quickly walks towards the exit to catch up with his group. I watch the band get into their slick black wagon and wave them goodbye until their car vanished into a corner.
			<br />
			<br />
			I look at the paper to view my most precious Led Zeppelin memorabilia but to my utter surprise, it is only an imprint of Bonham’s autograph. I look at the pen and notice that I had forgotten to bring out the nib of that diabolic click pen before handing it over to Bonham. It was hilarious but at the same time, a bit disappointing. But watching Led Zeppelin perform live, then shaking hands with Jimmy and getting an imprint of Bonham’s autograph was enough for me to hold on to that newspaper snippet like it was the holy grail of the music world. Finally, I wake up from this abstruse dream.
