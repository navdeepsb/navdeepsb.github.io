After a busy half-day of joyful laughs and the dreamy school chores, I managed to pick up a seat in my school bus. Usually, I would throw my bag on this seat to reserve it and race down to where my friends were standing to tell and hear some of the most spectacular real stories children could ever imagine, but today was different. Today I didn't want to take any chances. I didn't want to flash silly smiles to my ruthless bus-mates who didn't heed my bag and claimed my seat. So I stayed in the bus. I fixed my eyes on the giant bronze school emblem that looked so magnificent on the front top of the red school building, shining like there was room for one more sun in this universe. I had to look at it. I had to look at it so I could prepare my eyes for the grand finale.<br /><br />Slowly and eventually, the volume of the roaring in the bus increased and then attained a level that made it impossible for me to catch the sound of the engine starting, otherwise for which my ears were super-sensitive as it signaled the end of my friendly chat and the time to board. The ground started moving and my journey began. The wind was kind enough to evaporate the sweat off of my head. I donned a huge smile on my face as I just couldn't control the enthusiasm of a ten year old. Today, I was going to be able to focus my entire attention on the single most important thing that had made my heart jump in joy the day before yesterday.<br /><br />After spending some time in the drowsy ride of my magic bus, the moment came for which I had been laying the red carpet for. The bus stopped and I prayed the person expected to get off the bus moved slowly. This way, I would get ample amount of time for my eyes to savor. My calculations regarding on which side of the bus I will be able to view my visual treat were correct and they had landed me on the starboard side of the bus. Without much ado, I turned my head to perfectly lock my eyes on this variegated jester that was standing outside a restaurant. He was wearing these red and blue clothes, an abstruse set of shoes and a peculiarly shaped hat that sat prominently on his head. My best guess was that he was hired by the restaurant owner to allure customers to this place. The trick was ingenious as I was not only allured but also genuinely mesmerized. I had seen many jesters before, but this one was unique. This one was full of tremendous verve and the sight of a colorful figure in a concrete landscape was just fantastic. He was jumping and juggling balls and as he did so, yellow, orange and green candies spilled from his pockets. Some desirous kids surrounding him were grabbing those candies even before they could touch the ground. I envied those kids as I couldn't relish any of that jester-bestowed candy myself. That big grin on the jester’s face was utterly genuine as he enjoyed every bit of his act. Just yesterday, I had visited this place in the evening with my parents in hopes of seeing the jester up close but I couldn’t find him then. I was sad and disappointed but today’s events had healed any wounds. Even today, a loud voice in my head was asking me to rush down the bus, meet the jester, have some candy and be back in a jiffy but I couldn’t oblige as my bus revived to move. I bid bye to the jester king and got myself a memory that I still cherish. <br /><br />This incident made me ponder upon the existence of tiny joys that exist in our otherwise mundane lives - the joys that go unnoticed until we recognize them. The giant green trees that you see behind the traffic signal while waiting on a red light or the cloud art seen in the sky every now and then or the dark cool shade beneath an array of overgrown bushes all bring much needed peace and calm to the restless mind. I have many such memoirs but the jester memoir sits on the top. These memoirs enrich my heart with joy and whenever I recall them I am filled with a profound nostalgia that never fails to leave me smiling.\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"creative-writing/the-jester-memoir\",\n\t\t\t\"timestamp\": \"Feb 2013\",\n\t\t\t\"show\": true\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"The Classic Rock Juggernaut\",\n\t\t\t\"content\": \"It is the 70's era, the peak of Classic Rock and Led Zeppelin, the Gods, are performing live in an auditorium. Although the size of the auditorium didn’t justify the greatness of this rock group, they are playing their hearts out. Astonishingly and rather so audaciously, the audience is very meager. I am standing closest to them and fully engaged in the mind-boggling super-experience. They are playing Good Times Bad Times and the guitar solo after that deliberate brief pause in the music lifts me away from this world and into the depths of psych and bliss. This was the last number they were going to perform before leaving for another gig. Parallel to this hall is another hall that connects the backstage to the exit. I migrate to this parallel hall in hopes of coming face-to-face with the greatest band ever and take autographs of the big four.<br /><br />I am standing close to the exit door and see Led Zeppelin coming towards me flocked with reporters, journalists and other crazy fans. I am holding a click pen and a scrap of newspaper for taking their autographs. A few photographers are also there bursting their camera flashes in the dim hall. Leading Led Zeppelin is mighty Jimmy Page. I shake hands with him and tell him that I'm a huge fan of his and that I want his autograph. He refuses and gushes to the exit. I am under extreme shock and before I could recover, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones have already walked past me. I bring myself to senses as soon as possible and ask John Bonham, the immortal king of the drummers, for his autograph. He gestures for a pen which I give him along with the paper. He signs \\\"Bonzo\\\" and quickly walks towards the exit to catch up with his group. I watch the band get into their slick black wagon and wave them goodbye until their car vanished into a corner.<br /><br />I look at the paper to view my most precious Led Zeppelin memorabilia but to my utter surprise, it is only an imprint of Bonham’s autograph. I look at the pen and notice that I had forgotten to bring out the nib of that diabolic click pen before handing it over to Bonham. It was hilarious but at the same time, a bit disappointing. But watching Led Zeppelin perform live, then shaking hands with Jimmy and getting an imprint of Bonham’s autograph was enough for me to hold on to that newspaper snippet like it was the holy grail of the music world. Finally, I wake up from this abstruse dream.\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"creative-writing/the-classic-rock-juggernaut\",\n\t\t\t\"timestamp\": \"Jun 2014\",\n\t\t\t\"show\": true\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"Good and Evil\",\n\t\t\t\"content\": \"As a boy I often thought,<br />Is Good and Evil all what the world has got?<br />Always comparing the two,<br />Without knowing the real Truth.<br />That is hidden beneath for so many years,<br />Only to be unveiled by smiles and fears.<br /><br />For all I remember from my brief childhood,<br />Had there been no Evil, we would have found it in Good.<br /><br />Darker the night, brighter gets the day.<br />Most violent of the storms precede calmness in their way.<br />One can’t love dearly without facing hate.<br />One can only treasure life if it escaped death's fate.<br />There is no friend's charm if there is no foe's spell.<br />No one would ever want heaven if there was no place as hell.<br /><br />If I could explain better, I would,<br />Had there been no Evil, we would have found it in Good.<br /><br />Why to learn to fly if one has never cried?<br />Why to put the second effort if one has never tried?<br />What is food without the existence of hunger?<br />What is recreation without anything to plunder?<br />Who will be the hero with no villain to kill?<br />Who will praise life without anything still?<br /><br />So let the Good remain pure.<br />And be Evil it’s only cure.<br />Let us have some triumphs to celebrate.<br />And let that Truth forever wait.<br />Let our lives be reigned by tears.<br />And follow our destiny with smiles and fears.<br /><br />Be it the last time I say,<br />Had there been no Evil, we would have found it in Good.\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"creative-writing/good-and-evil\",\n\t\t\t\"timestamp\": \"May 2011\",\n\t\t\t\"show\": false\n\t\t},\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"title\": \"The Beatles Dream\",\n\t\t\t\"content\": \"It is The Beatles era around the mid 60’s. John Lennon and Paul McCartney are sitting on a long table addressing a press conference, answering questions and sharing thoughts about their next album. Ringo and George are not there. I am very near to that long table almost touching it. I pick up a greeting card from in front of them (which apparently they had received from another fan). It was sea green color and the inside was almost blank with just the upper right-side being scribbled. I took out a pen from my pocket and forwarded it along with the card to Lennon to have his autograph. He outright refuses and gestures me to have a seat with a look of despise on his face. I am heart-broken because of the fact I have always been the Lennon fan and not a McCartney fan. But to my surprise, Paul takes the pen and the card from me with a big smile on his face. He turns the inside of the card for everyone sitting in the room to see and starts writing on it. He writes 'from John' and pauses to look at Lennon who gives a nod and Paul completes Lennon's signature. He then also adds 'and Paul McCartney' and then a message which my memory can't recall. Then as an icing on the cake he asks my name. I tell it and he writes 'for Nav' and then looks at me for the remaining alphabets. I reply 'D-E-E-P'. By this time, big tears have started forming in my eyes and as he hands over the finished memorabilia, I am sobbing in joy. And then, I wake up.

You just needed to get ready, hop on the vehicle that would take you to the lawns, bits of shy 'Hi's and 'Hello's there, a little stomach stuffing and then you dozed off right there despite of the loud noise. You would eventually wake up in your warm cozy bed the next morning and there would of course be flashes of how your mother or father carried you around, then put you in the vehicle and how he/she accidentally bumped your head with the door. Your head would hurt a little when you think about it. You would then go to school and share this experience with your friends in the lunch break- what you ate, what you saw and about that oddly-dressed old lady about whom you were convinced she puts little kids in her giant bag. And now that you've grown up you're an important part of the family contingent that goes to attend the wedding. You can't sleep off and most of all you can't hide.

In this way, the form components change position due to the addition of an extra element in the DOM. Consider a mobile device environment where the viewport is further reduced by the keyboard panel.

take a glance and look at all the visual treats this world had to offer me. After a busy half-day of joyful laughs and the dreamy school chores, I managed to pick up a seat in my school bus. Usually, I would throw my bag on this seat to reserve it and race down to where my friends were standing to tell and hear some of the most spectacular real stories children could ever imagine, but today was different. Today I didn't want to take any chances. I didn't want to flash silly smiles to my ruthless bus-mates who didn't heed my bag and claimed my seat. So I stayed in the bus. I fixed my eyes on the giant bronze school emblem that looked so magnificent on the front top of the red school building, shining like there was room for one more sun in this universe. I had to look at it. I had to look at it so I could prepare my eyes for the grand finale.<br /><br />Slowly and eventually, the volume of the roaring in the bus increased and then attained a level that made it impossible for me to catch the sound of the engine starting, otherwise for which my ears were super-sensitive as it signaled the end of my friendly chat and the time to board. The ground started moving and my journey began. The wind was kind enough to evaporate the sweat off of my head. I donned a huge smile on my face as I just couldn't control the enthusiasm of a ten year old. Today, I was going to be able to focus my entire attention on the single most important thing that had made my heart jump in joy the day before yesterday.<br /><br />After spending some time in the drowsy ride of my magic bus, the moment came for which I had been laying the red carpet for. The bus stopped and I prayed the person expected to get off the bus moved slowly. This way, I would get ample amount of time for my eyes to savor. My calculations regarding on which side of the bus I will be able to view my visual treat were correct and they had landed me on the starboard side of the bus. Without much ado, I turned my head to perfectly lock my eyes on this variegated jester that was standing outside a restaurant. He was wearing these red and blue clothes, an abstruse set of shoes and a peculiarly shaped hat that sat prominently on his head. My best guess was that he was hired by the restaurant owner to allure customers to this place. The trick was ingenious as I was not only allured but also genuinely mesmerized. I had seen many jesters before, but this one was unique. This one was full of tremendous verve and the sight of a colorful figure in a concrete landscape was just fantastic. He was jumping and juggling balls and as he did so, yellow, orange and green candies spilled from his pockets. Some desirous kids surrounding him were grabbing those candies even before they could touch the ground. I envied those kids as I couldn't relish any of that jester-bestowed candy myself. That big grin on the jester’s face was utterly genuine as he enjoyed every bit of his act. Just yesterday, I had visited this place in the evening with my parents in hopes of seeing the jester up close but I couldn’t find him then. I was sad and disappointed but today’s events had healed any wounds. Even today, a loud voice in my head was asking me to rush down the bus, meet the jester, have some candy and be back in a jiffy but I couldn’t oblige as my bus revived to move. I bid bye to the jester king and got myself a memory that I still cherish. <br /><br />This incident made me ponder upon the existence of tiny joys that exist in our otherwise mundane lives - the joys that go unnoticed until we recognize them. The giant green trees that you see behind the traffic signal while waiting on a red light or the cloud art seen in the sky every now and then or the dark cool shade beneath an array of overgrown bushes all bring much needed peace and calm to the restless mind. I have many such memoirs but the jester memoir sits on the top. These memoirs enrich my heart with joy and whenever I recall them I am filled with a profound nostalgia that never fails to leave me smiling.\",\n\t\t\"path\": \"creative-writing/the-jester-memoir\",\n\t\t\"timestamp\": \"Feb 2013\",\n\t\t\"show\": true\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"title\": \"The Classic Rock Juggernaut\",\n\t\t\"content\": \"It is the 70's era, the peak of Classic Rock and Led Zeppelin, the Gods, are performing live in an auditorium. Although the size of the auditorium didn’t justify the greatness of this rock group, they are playing their hearts out. Astonishingly and rather so audaciously, the audience is very meager. I am standing closest to them and fully engaged in the mind-boggling super-experience. They are playing Good Times Bad Times and the guitar solo after that deliberate brief pause in the music lifts me away from this world and into the depths of psych and bliss. This was the last number they were going to perform before leaving for another gig. Parallel to this hall is another hall that connects the backstage to the exit. I migrate to this parallel hall in hopes of coming face-to-face with the greatest band ever and take autographs of the big four.<br /><br />I am standing close to the exit door and see Led Zeppelin coming towards me flocked with reporters, journalists and other crazy fans. I am holding a click pen and a scrap of newspaper for taking their autographs. A few photographers are also there bursting their camera flashes in the dim hall. Leading Led Zeppelin is mighty Jimmy Page. I shake hands with him and tell him that I'm a huge fan of his and that I want his autograph. He refuses and gushes to the exit. I am under extreme shock and before I could recover, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones have already walked past me. I bring myself to senses as soon as possible and ask John Bonham, the immortal king of the drummers, for his autograph. He gestures for a pen which I give him along with the paper. He signs \\\"Bonzo\\\" and quickly walks towards the exit to catch up with his group. I watch the band get into their slick black wagon and wave them goodbye until their car vanished into a corner.<br /><br />I look at the paper to view my most precious Led Zeppelin memorabilia but to my utter surprise, it is only an imprint of Bonham’s autograph. I look at the pen and notice that I had forgotten to bring out the nib of that diabolic click pen before handing it over to Bonham. It was hilarious but at the same time, a bit disappointing. But watching Led Zeppelin perform live, then shaking hands with Jimmy and getting an imprint of Bonham’s autograph was enough for me to hold on to that newspaper snippet like it was the holy grail of the music world. Finally, I wake up from this abstruse dream.\",\n\t\t\"path\": \"creative-writing/the-classic-rock-juggernaut\",\n\t\t\"timestamp\": \"Jun 2014\",\n\t\t\"show\": true\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"title\": \"Good and Evil\",\n\t\t\"content\": \"As a boy I often thought,<br />Is Good and Evil all what the world has got?<br />Always comparing the two,<br />Without knowing the real Truth.<br />That is hidden beneath for so many years,<br />Only to be unveiled by smiles and fears.<br /><br />For all I remember from my brief childhood,<br />Had there been no Evil, we would have found it in Good.<br /><br />Darker the night, brighter gets the day.<br />Most violent of the storms precede calmness in their way.<br />One can’t love dearly without facing hate.<br />One can only treasure life if it escaped death's fate.<br />There is no friend's charm if there is no foe's spell.<br />No one would ever want heaven if there was no place as hell.<br /><br />If I could explain better, I would,<br />Had there been no Evil, we would have found it in Good.<br /><br />Why to learn to fly if one has never cried?<br />Why to put the second effort if one has never tried?<br />What is food without the existence of hunger?<br />What is recreation without anything to plunder?<br />Who will be the hero with no villain to kill?<br />Who will praise life without anything still?<br /><br />So let the Good remain pure.<br />And be Evil it’s only cure.<br />Let us have some triumphs to celebrate.<br />And let that Truth forever wait.<br />Let our lives be reigned by tears.<br />And follow our destiny with smiles and fears.<br /><br />Be it the last time I say,<br />Had there been no Evil, we would have found it in Good.\",\n\t\t\"path\": \"creative-writing/good-and-evil\",\n\t\t\"timestamp\": \"May 2011\",\n\t\t\"show\": false\n\t},\n\t{\n\t\t\"title\": \"The Beatles Dream\",\n\t\t\"content\": \"It is The Beatles era around the mid 60’s. John Lennon and Paul McCartney are sitting on a long table addressing a press conference, answering questions and sharing thoughts about their next album. Ringo and George are not there. I am very near to that long table almost touching it. I pick up a greeting card from in front of them (which apparently they had received from another fan). It was sea green color and the inside was almost blank with just the upper right-side being scribbled. I took out a pen from my pocket and forwarded it along with the card to Lennon to have his autograph. He outright refuses and gestures me to have a seat with a look of despise on his face. I am heart-broken because of the fact I have always been the Lennon fan and not a McCartney fan. But to my surprise, Paul takes the pen and the card from me with a big smile on his face. He turns the inside of the card for everyone sitting in the room to see and starts writing on it. He writes 'from John' and pauses to look at Lennon who gives a nod and Paul completes Lennon's signature. He then also adds 'and Paul McCartney' and then a message which my memory can't recall. Then as an icing on the cake he asks my name. I tell it and he writes 'for Nav' and then looks at me for the remaining alphabets. I reply 'D-E-E-P'. By this time, big tears have started forming in my eyes and as he hands over the finished memorabilia, I am sobbing in joy. And then, I wake up.

A common way to convey error messages in forms are to insert an error text right below the input field or above the action button. In this way, the form components change position due to the addition of an extra element in the DOM. Consider a mobile device environment where the viewport is further reduced by the keyboard panel. If the input field is not focussed after the error has occurred, it might be the case that the user can totally ignore the error message and he/she can get confused regarding the form not being submitted despite clicking on the button.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        Other applications of Badger include displaying quick notifications to the user. These notifications stack one above the other and stay on top of the screen. The notifications can be of 3 types – success, warn and error. They can be short-lived (3 seconds by default) or made to persist until the user taps on them to make them go away. Badger is highly configurable and one can alter the appearance of the notification cards to match the colour scheme of one’s website.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"content-block\">\n                    <h4>Demo</h4>\n                    <p><img src={ require( \"./demo.gif\" ) } alt=\"Demonstration gif of Badger\" /></p>\n                    <p>\n                        Regardless of the size of the viewport, the user will definitely see the card as it appears on the top of the screen. Moreover, the form components with which the user has gotten accustomed to do not change their positions at all. This Badger goes away automatically after a configurable \"stay\" time.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        Badger can be effectively used in lengthy forms and to display the results of AJAX requests on the webpage. For example, a user edits his profile and updates the display picture of his account. Instead of finding the best place to show the result of this upload, we can use Badger - a green Badger with appropriate message to show success and a red Badger in case the upload fails.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"content-block\">\n                    <h4>Source Code</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        The library is written in <a href=\"http://coffeescript.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" tabIndex=\"-1\">CoffeeScript</a> that transpiles into JavaScript and has a dependency on <a href=\"https://jquery.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" tabIndex=\"-1\">jQuery</a>.

I probed when I thought I could not get enough information but also followed the practice of observing quietly when needed.

Housie involves one player, the moderator, to draw numbers randomly from a pool of chips numbered 1-90 and places them on a physical board to keep track of the numbers drawn. The other players get a stub with random numbers on them. As the moderator calls out the number, the players strike off a number if it matches the number drawn. Prices are won on the basis of certain rules like striking all the numbers in one row, striking the first sever numbers and so on.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        My younger sister was the staple moderator in our group and the rest of us would play and reap benefits of winning prices. This would deprive my sister of playing the game herself. On one opportune day, I thought of outsourcing the number drawing to a computer program. Random number generation is not a big deal to code so I decided to automate Housie through a web application. I designed the interface to keep it as close to the real game and developed the app within a day. My attempt was a successful one and after initial trials and fixing minor bugs, Lusie was born! Now we just had to start/stop the game and rest was taken care by Lusie.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"content-block\">\n                    <h4>The Web App</h4>\n                    <p>Below is a ridiculously simple layout for the app. Gigantic number depicts the current number drawn and the circled numbers are the ones already drawn.

It’s majorly a solo exercise because of varying personal preferences and one can do it anytime and anywhere. But there are beginners and people who relocate who constitute the community that I targeted. A person who has just begun running or relocated to a new place is all on their own without any proper guidance and motivation. They require relevant information such as the best places to run, running plans to follow, etc. Through this app, I wanted to eliminate the decision-making involved in wayfinding during a run so the user can have a seamless running experience.\n                    </p>\n                    <br />\n                    <p><a href={ require( \"./run-finder-final-report.pdf\" ) } target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" tabIndex=\"-1\" title=\"Run Finder Final Report\">Final report</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href={ require( \"./run-finder-final-presentation.pdf\" ) } target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" tabIndex=\"-1\" title=\"Run Finder Final Presentation\">Final presentation</a></p>\n                </div>\n                <div className=\"content-block\">\n                    <h4>The Process</h4>\n                    <p>\n                        The inner sound of the developer side of mine resounded \"An app!\" and I immediately started thinking of features of the app. But during the course of this project, I learned that technical intervention might not always be the correct solution.

Especially during nights... Once, I was using Google Maps for getting back home and it took me through a very secluded area which didn’t even had a proper road. There were these overgrown trees... It was really scary.”\n                            <br />\n                            <br />\n                            “It (safety) is important because you never know what’s gonna happen.

Always fascinated by User Interface design, I discovered my affinity for User Experience while working on my startup’s website where I made key decisions as a Front-End Developer to make the experience of a visitor seamless and worthwhile. At grad school, I am honing my UI/UX skills by applying various concepts learned in real-world projects. I have come to know that iteration and feedback are important aspects of a design process  and one should focus on the user problem rather than the volatile solution.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        I also have a natural inclination towards graphic design which is evident from this portfolio which I designed on my own in Adobe XD. I keep my designs simple, meaningful and insightful. I like to think of graphic design as an opportunity to convey information in an open and creative manner.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        Having worked in the professional industry and having co-founded a startup, I am adept in collaborating effectively with teams comprising diverse roles as well as staying self-motivated for long spells. Possessing both development and design skills, I stand out as an aspiring UX professional.\n                        <br /><br />\n                        <img src={ devDesSrc } alt=\"Development plus design equals awesome!\" />\n                        <br /><br />\n                        When I am not UI/UXing, I like to write short articles, play my acoustic guitar and explore new sounds on Spotify or YouTube. I love to groove to the likes of Tame Impala, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard and Mac DeMarco. I am also a nature lover and a Star Wars geek.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n                <p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n                    <img src={ bottomImageSrc } alt=\"Image of me overlooking the Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir, India\" />\n                </p>\n            </div>\n        );\n    }\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./ui/screens/about/main.jsx","// style-loader: Adds some css to the DOM by adding a <style> tag\n\n// load the styles\nvar content = require(\"!!./../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!./../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js!./style.scss\");\nif(typeof content === 'string') content = [[module.id, content, '']];\n// add the styles to the DOM\nvar update = require(\"!./../../../node_modules/style-loader/addStyles.js\")(content, {});\nif(content.locals) module.exports = content.locals;\n// Hot Module Replacement\nif(module.hot) {\n\t// When the styles change, update the <style> tags\n\tif(!content.locals) {\n\t\tmodule.hot.accept(\"!!./../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!./../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js!./style.scss\", function() {\n\t\t\tvar newContent = require(\"!!./../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!./../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js!./style.scss\");\n\t\t\tif(typeof newContent === 'string') newContent = [[module.id, newContent, '']];\n\t\t\tupdate(newContent);\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\t// When the module is disposed, remove the <style> tags\n\tmodule.hot.dispose(function() { update();
